			<p><h3>Day One</h3><br>
				Orientation with John Wark.<br>
				 -Mostly average stuff, going over policies and basic house manners.  <br>
				Installed text editor, gitbash, some add-ons.<br>
				 -No great trouble with most installs, felt pretty comfortable with command line but needed brushing up.  Think we got Zsh installed, which was the hardest.

			<p><h3>Day Two</h3><br>
				Watched Cohort 18 capstones.<br>
				 -Some pretty impressive projects, a few not.  My goal is definitely to make one better than what I saw.  Some of the better ones were: coffee snob, wig finder.  Having a hardtime remember lots of individual ones. <br>
				Questions for Brenda and free work time. <br>
				 -Visual Studio seems like it is for people much further along than this.  Worked on this exercis - presonal blog page.

			<p><h3>Day Three</h3><br>
				Demo'd HTML &amp CSS.<br>
				-Built Wizard of Oz page with some links, pictures, and css.  Mostly review of prework and what I already know, just brushing up. <br>

				-My quick steps for creating repo:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Create repo on github account - Note:consider readme.md creation.</li>
					<li>With terminal, change directory to where you want repo.</li>
					<li>Enter "git init".</li>
					<li>Add all files to repo, ie. "git add filename.type".</li>
					<li>Commit files, ie "git commit -m "message"".</li>
					<li>Enter "git remote add origin <i>givendestinationfromgithub</i>".</li>
					<li>Push, ie. "git push -u origin master".</li>
				</ol>

			<p><h3>Day Four</h3><br>
				Practiced Git Flow<br>
				-Learned about push, pull, pull request, merging, and branching.  Practiced a few iterations of the loop.  I understand the importance of the flow for team projects, having a master that is the same for everyone.<br>
				Steve Presented Education Strategy<br>
				-Two most important things of teamwork- communication and compassion.  Surprised at first to see compassion there.  Also, adult learning is best done by revisiting topics after a few days, to cement knowledge.  After this we had some time for free work.

			<p><h3>Day Five</h3><br>
				Free Work<br>
				-Finished almost all the exercises, minus the HTML ones, which I work on as I write this.  Some other students started a group challenge, and I want in, but it got too far along before I knew.  Currently stuck on a javascript exercise, the Temp converter.  I have often had a hard time bridging between different files, ie. getting info from html page and using it in javascript.
