			<p><h3>Day One</h3><br>
			Orientation with John Wark.<br>
			 Mostly average stuff, going over policies and basic house manners.  <br>
			Installed text editor, gitbash, some add-ons<br>
			 No great trouble with most installs, felt pretty comfortable with command line but needed brushing up.  Think we got Zsh installed, which was the hardest.</p>

			<p><h3>Day Two</h3><br>
			Watched Cohort 18 capstones.<br>
			 Some pretty impressive projects, a few not.  My goal is definitely to make one better than what I saw.  Some of the better ones were: coffee snob, wig finder.  Having a hardtime remember lots of individual ones. <br>
			Questions for Brenda and free work time. <br>
			 Visual Studio seems like it is for people much further along than this.  Worked on this exercis - presonal blog page.

			<p><h3>Day Three</h3><br>
			Demo'd HTML &amp CSS.<br>
			Built Wizard of Oz page with some links, pictures, and css.  Mostly review of prework and what I already know, just brushing up. <br>
			Learned about repos and committing.<br>
			My quick steps for creating repo:<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Create repo on github account - Note:consider readme.md creation.</li>
				<li>With terminal, change directory to where you want repo.</li>
				<li>Enter "git init".</li>
				<li>Add all files to repo, ie. "git add filename.type".</li>
				<li>Commit files, ie "git commit -m "message"".</li>
				<li>Enter "git remote add origin <i>givendestinationfromgithub</i>".</li>
				<li>Push, ie. "git push -u origin master".</li>
			</ol>
